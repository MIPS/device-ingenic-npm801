    $ . build/envsetup.sh
    $ export TOP=`pwd`

2. Choose target:
    $ lunch aosp_npm801-userdebug

3. Build everything.
    $ make -j24

Installing bootloader (xboot)
=============================

You will need to install xboot if the device does not have a fastboot
capable bootloader installed or the xboot version has changed. it is
*REQUIRED* to update xboot when switching from a full_npm801 build to
aosp_npm801.

1. Connect the device to PC by USB cable and plug charger into the device.

2. Put device into USB-BOOT mode by pressing both Vol+ and reset at
   the same time. Keep Vol+ pressed for approximately 2 seconds. Note
   that the screen will remain blank in this mode.

3. Check that the device has entered USB boot mode correctly using
   'lsusb'. The device should show up as:
       Bus ??? Device ???: ID a108:4780

5. Update xboot:
   $ cd $TOP/device/ingenic/npm801/ingenic-xboot-updater
   $ sudo ./ingenic-xboot-updater --boot=x-boot-nand.bin


Flashing Android to device
==========================

1. Connect the device to PC by USB cable and plug charger into the device.

2. Press 'return' and do a reset; keep 'return' key pressed until
   fastboot screen appears.

3. The USB icon in the center of screen will show if you have a proper
   USB connection.

3. Run fastboot on host. You can run fastboot as a normal user if your udev rules
   include the tablet device ID. Otherwise, otherwise you need to run fastboot as root:
   $ sudo -s
   # cd $TOP
   # fastboot flashall

The fastboot process takes approximately 15 minutes.
